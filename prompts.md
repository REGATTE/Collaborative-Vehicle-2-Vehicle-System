# Initial prompt

Im doing this for a project. 

The project entails a main ego vehicle, and other smart vehicles with the same sensor suite. I would like the other vehicles to share their sensor data, with the ego vehicle when they are close to make sure ego vehicle can plan its route better. 

I want to start the full simulation for Carla, using the pygame window with master.py. use another file for ego_vehicle.py to control the ego_vehicle, and generate_traffic.py to launch other smart vehicles and random vehicles. 

please give code for master.py accordingly
